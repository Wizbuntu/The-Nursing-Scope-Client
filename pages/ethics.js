                                        <p className="pt-3 lh-lg">Ethical considerations and the morals underlying it are among what The Nursing Scope prioritizes as its central qualities. The journal, therefore, adheres to international ethical standards for publication.</p>

                                        <p className="pt-3 lh-lg">To guarantee compliance with ethical standards, The Nursing Scope utilizes a double-blinded audit process to approve and validate that works are in compliance with ethical standard prior to publication. This auditing process by the journal acts as a filter not only to ensure compliance with ethical standards but also to enhance the quality of articles submitted for publication.</p>

                                        <p className="pt-3 lh-lg">The Nursing Scope follows the best practices on ethical matters, errors, and retractions to deliver the best ethical standards on publication. The journal takes all possible measures against publication malpractices. All manuscripts found running afoul of this publication ethics and malpractice statement will be removed from the journal, even if the malpractice was discovered at a later time after the publication has been made.</p>
